## **Data Source**

The data utilized in this analysis is obtained from FAOSTAT, a comprehensive database provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The dataset contains information on crops, production quantities, harvested areas, and yields spanning several decades., production quantities, harvested areas, and yields spanning several decades.

## **Data Dictionary**

The dataset contains the following columns:
- Domain: The domain of the data that was removed during data cleaning.
- Area: The country where the data was collected.
- Element: The type of data (e.g., production, area harvested, yield).
- Item: The crop or item being measured.
- Year: The year of the data.
- Unit: The unit of measurement for the data.
- Value: The numerical value of the data.
- Flag: Indicators for data quality and status.
- Flag Description: Descriptions of the flags.

## **Data Loading**

### **Creating a table**

## **Findings**

- Sugar cane is the most produced crop, with production increasing from 200 million tonnes in 1961 to 1195 million in 2022. Brazil has been the leading producer since 1982, surpassing India, accounting for 60% of the total production 2022.

- In 2022, wheat was the second most harvested crop, with more than 75 million hectares. Asian countries are the largest producers, with almost 60 million hectares of harvest area. Russiaâ€™s most produced and harvested crop is wheat. 

- In 2022, corn was the second most produced crop. However, its production was 300 million tonnes less than the previous year. The United States harvested almost 50% of its area and became the largest producer, accounting for approx 70% of the total production.

- In 2022, soya beans were the most harvested crops, with over 90 million hectares. Meanwhile, the soya bean is the second most harvested and produced crop in the United States, lacking Brazil by only 4% of total production.

- In the United States, corn has been the most produced crop since 1961. The highest amount of corn was produced in 2016, with over 400 million tonnes, accounting for more than 50% of the total production.
